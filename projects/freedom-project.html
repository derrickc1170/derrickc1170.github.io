            <h1 class="margin text-center">Freedom Project</h1>
            <p>SEP Freedom Project was about how we got to choose our own topic and create a website based on it, using what we learned in class.</p>
            <p>I chose cooking as my topic because I thought it would be interesting to see how cooking evolved in future. I used A-Frame to make a 3D website that build a 3D Model and tools related to cooking.</p>
            <p>The reason why my teacher gave us this project was to let us explore something we're interested in and make in a website. This project took a really long time to make something</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>Before building the website, we also had to create a wireframe. 
            This helped me plan out the layout of my pages and think about what I wanted to include before I started coding. 
            It made the process a lot more organized and helped me stay on track.</p>
            <p>Also I have to do research my tool which it is Aframe where it is able to make 3D model in Like VR which we can see in my log</p>
            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>
            One of the biggest challenges I faced was time. I didn’t manage my time well. Because of that, the final project felt like half finished canvas. 
            I also had a lack of motivation to work on it at first because I was really busy. 
            I had to go on a camping trip for about 3 days after that I only had 2 days left to finish the project.
            </p>
            <h2>Next Step</h2>
            <p>
            If I had more time, I would maybe change the background to make it look better and not bland. 
            I’d also use the feedback from my peers to improve my website and make it easier.
            </p>
